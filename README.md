# msscellparse
Weave a network topology from mobile switch logs

The idea here is to be able to sum up the *topology* of network cells based on commands given to the switches and soft switches.
It shall help me learn how to code a focused parser and also help on my job. As a side effect I hope it can help others with similar problems. Feel free to fork it if you find it usefull.
